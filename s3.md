Amazon S3 - Buckets
--
- Amazon $3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- 53 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
- No uppercase, No underscore
- 3-63 characters long
- Not an IP/
- Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Must NOT start with the prefix xn-
- Must NOT end with the suffix -salias

Amazon S3 - Objects
--
- Objects (files) have a Key
- The key is the FULL path:
- s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
- 53://my-bucket/my_folder|/another_folder/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of prefix + object name
- s3://my-bucket/my_folder|/another_folder/my_file.txt
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets
(although the Ul will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("'")
-  Object values are the content of the body:
- Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
- If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

Access the bucket objects
--
- We can access the bucket object directly by clicking on OPEN
![image](https://github.com/pavankumar0077/aws-sol-architect/assets/40380941/28405d10-3cce-445e-8da0-09852698d124)

- It opens a very long URL -- WHICH IS CALLED AS S3 PRE-SIGNED URL which is very very long url (It contains the signature that i am verify user)
- If we use OBJECT ULR -- WE WILL GET THE ACCESS DEINED ERROR BY DEFAULT.

S3 Security
--
### User-Based
- IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from AM
### Resource-Based
- Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
- Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
- Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)
### Note: an IAM principal can access an 53 object if
- The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
- AND there's no explicit DENY

### Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys
