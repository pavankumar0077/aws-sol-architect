Instantiating Applications quickly
--
- When launching a full stack (EC2, EBS, RDS), it can take time to:
- Install applications
- Insert initial (or recovery) data
- Configure everything
- Launch the application
- We can take advantage of the cloud to speed that up!

EC2 Instances:
--
- Use a Golden AMl: Install your applications, OS dependencies etc.. beforehand
and launch your EC2 instance from the Golden AMI
- Bootstrap using User Data: For dynamic configuration, use User Data scripts
- Hybrid: mix Golden AMl and User Data (Elastic Beanstalk)

RDS Databases:
--
- Restore from a snapshot: the database will have schemas and data ready!

EBS Volumes:
--
- Restore from a snapshot: the disk will already be formatted and have data!
